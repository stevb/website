#### Northern Nicaragua 

After four or five days of resting in LeÃ³n I left the city seemingly feeling more tired than when I arrived. I had taken some time off to do a few touristy things in and around town but felt both physically and mentally exhausted when I hopped back on the bike. I hadn't been feeling super great before LeÃ³n and was in a bit of a mental slump; sometimes the trip can become routine and if paired with enough difficult days I can really begin to question what exactly it is that I'm looking for out here. So with that on my mind, I left the city in the late morning and rode toward a far-off intersection.

The sage, older Austrian cyclist with whom I'd camped at the Costa Rican/Panamanian border had recommended the mountains of northern Nicaragua as one of the most interesting parts of his trip, away from the "gringo trail" I'd been riding for the past few weeks. On the one hand I wanted to just make some more progress, stay in the flats, and continue straight to Honduras but on the other hand I was also curious about this less well-travelled part of the country. I continued to delay my decision until I made it to a convenience store at the intersection where I'd either have turn left or continue going straight. I bought a drink and chatted with a man in a bus stop who was from the city of EstelÃ­ in the mountaineous north; he recommended I continue that way, "it's beautiful" he said. It was enough for me to go off of, I wished him a nice day, and continued on the bike. For the next two days I'd be cycling in a westerly direction into some pretty strong headwinds; it was challenging but at least a bit refreshing.

The first night after having left Leon I made it as far as El Jicaral where I cycled past a firehouse sometime around 17:30. I turned back around to chat with the guys outside and to ask about a place to camp. Again, it was no problem to set my tent up behind their building. We all chatted out back for a bit and looked for a spot without ants (suprisingly hard to find here). Before I'd had the chance to setup my camp a few heavy rain squalls passed through and we decided it was probably best that I camp in the garage. We all had dinner together and chatted some more before turning in. The following morning we all had breakfast together, the guys prepared to end their multi-day shift, and I hit the road.

It was Good Friday and everything was closed as I continued into a fierce little easterly wind. For the next few hours I settled in on the bike, rested on the handlebars, and just watched the cranks spin below me. I made it to a big intersection near San Isidro and made a 90 degree left turn; finally the windy part was over. I rode through two fairly large towns but found nearly everything closed with a few people out and about. I continued on and eventually found a small convenience stoor with an open door. I walked in to buy a few things chatted briefly with the lady. She told me that she wanted to help me by fixing me a plate of food with sardines (Good Friday), tamal, beans, avocado, and rice. It was a nice moment, I was appreciative for the food, the company, and the boost. I continued on a bit longer that day and made it to another intersection. To the left, up a long ascending road I'd heard lived a man who's spent the last forty years sculpting a cliff face. Going straight would take me on an easy road to EstelÃ­, the biggest city in the area. There was a small building with a universally understood coffee cup sign hanging by the door. I asked the lady if she had any coffee, she said she did but I'd have to wait for her to make it. "Tranquilo, todo bien," I said, I've got nothing but time (not sure yet how to say that in Spanish). I asked her about the sculptor and she told me it was worth a visit. I asked her if there were places to camp up the hill to which she said no, not really, but you can sleep here if you'd like, there's a spare bedroom and everything. Have a seat, here's your coffee, there's basketball on the TV. She invited some family over and I chatted with her son as we watched Marquette play NC State. We ate dinner together and had some coffee as they asked me about where I'm from and what life is like there. I thought about how incredible it is that I get to end up in these funny, serendipitous situations and how amazingly hospitable people can be.


The following morning, Maria-Ines, the lady at whose house I slept told me there was a bus I could take up the hill if I wanted to avoid a morning of steep climbing. The literal big yellow school bus pulled up outside and honked its horn as I quickly collected my things and we lifted my bike and myself into the back of the bus. I was off and running up the hill.




Sometime around sunset I arrived back in EstelÃ­ in the back of the pickup truck. I thanked the man for the ride, we lifted my bike out, and I rode to the hospital. I waited for a bit and was eventually attended to by a doctor. The eyebrow doesn't need stiches and your leg isn't broken. An assistant helped to clean and dress my wounds. Returning to the doctor seated behind the desk I asked her if I owed anything, she chuckled and said no, you're free to go. It was dark as I rode back to the main square in town looking for a hostel. I found one that fit the bill, checked into my bunk, and sent a message to my family that started with "I'm fine, but..." It felt embarrassing more than anything. Just a few short months since my first crash and here I was again. 

I slept in as best I could the next morning and then stripped all of the bags off of my bike. I rode to the bike shop that was recommended by one of the guys from the crash. They said they could help me make it rideable again; "come back later to pick it up." Later ended up being the following morning when I rode the bus back down to the shop. They made the bike rideable again but a proper fix was beyond their abilities. They bent the fork back a bit and shaved a bit of metal from the front brake mount. I bought a few small maintenance items that I needed and rode the bike back to the hostel. I immediately noticed a strong tendency for the bike to turn left, this on account of the left fork blade being pushed forward. 

For the next week I stayed at the hostel in EstelÃ­ as I tried to work out how best to continue with the bike and to give my body some time to recover. People came and went at the hostel as I stayed. I'd wake up and sit at the edge of the bed, preparing to limp over to the bathroom, as I began to really wonder what in the hell I was doing. Is this all really worth it? When I was still working I'd read lots of books, watch plenty of documentaries, and generally consume any kind of media that presented these big, life changing trips. "Sure, I'll have one of those, please!" I thought. And then you're sitting there on the side of the bed and thinking of all the ways it's not this perfectly presentable finished product. It's flawed in so many ways. My bike is bent, there's not a single bag on my bike without a rip in it, my cycling shirt is filled with holes, the upper part of my shorts is now several shades darker than the lower, sunbleached parts, the Buddhist prayer flags that I bought to comemorate the start of my trip are stiched and glued together somewhere between Om and Ma, my second pair of glasses has shattered, there are toolsets that are no longer complete, and even my cooking pot somehow has dents in it. 

If I was going to be here for a while I figured I may as well go see the town. On my first pass through these parts I remarked at how many tobacco fields and drying houses I cycled past. Maria-Ines's son also told me that he works as a cigar roller in EstelÃ­. Cigars are called "puros" here. On one of several walks from or to the bike shop I chatted with some Americans on the street who were smoking cigars. They recommended the AJ Fernandez tour as the best one around. "Ask for Mario!" So I rode over to the factory one day and talked to Mario, "come back at 13:30" he told me. I guess it's customary to pay for the tour in US dollars because asking to pay in the local Nicaraguan Cordobas was met with confusion. A general observation has been that people can be quite afraid to take responibility for actions at work when there's a higher up that could then accuse them of doing something wrong. A few phone calls were made, "can someone pay in Cordobas?" A few more were made, "what's the exchange rate?" And a final "Is this amount correct?" A French couple joined us on the tour as their kids waited in the lobby. We were given the option to smoke a cigar while taking the tour, I figured I might as well.
