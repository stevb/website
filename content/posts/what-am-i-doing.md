I've started writing this a couple of times, and I've started over a couple of times, each time not quite finding the words that felt right. In short, I'm going on a bike ride because it's a long-held dream and now's my chance to do it. To, for a short while, distill my life down to the essence and to see how much I can enjoy watching the sunrise.

In early January I'll make my way down to southern Argentina, to the town of Ushuaia, a town which claims the superlative of "southernmost city in the world." From there, it's a simple matter of cycling northwards as there aren't many options in the other cardinal directions.

As the trip steadily and surely approaches, I spend most of my idle time wondering how far I can really go. Staring at maps for the past several years, I've concluded that the whole of the Americas is filled with interesting little corners waiting to be discovered, if not for the first time then at least for me. I'm setting out to put myself through something, a DIY rite of passage, to test my mettle, to try something big, unsure of my ability to see it through, to see what I'm capable of and at the very least, to see value in the face of failure. A rolling meditation enjoying the simple life. To smile at some people along the way and to know that that's enough.

I made this little website in the hopes that I can regularly post small updates for friends and family and to teach myself a tiny bit about very basic, static website design.
