After a few days with the Heaton family I hit the road again planning to follow a backcountry route through the Cascades; a few cold rainy days put and end to that idea.</p><iframe width=100% height=600px frameborder=0 src="https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/post21_winter_break_1218525?scaleControl=true&miniMap=true&scrollWheelZoom=true&zoomControl=true&allowEdit=false&moreControl=false&searchControl=false&tilelayersControl=false&embedControl=false&datalayersControl=false&onLoadPanel=none&captionBar=true//"></iframe><p>Back when I left San Francisco, I had decided to continue northwards, keeping my original goal of riding to Alaska instead of opting to ride to the east coast and finishing my trip in Virginia. I had switched out sleeping bags and packed some warmer clothes thinking that ought to be enough. I&rsquo;d heard mixed stories of Alaska in the winter time; some said &ldquo;no problem,&rdquo; others said &ldquo;no way!&rdquo; I figured I&rsquo;d just go see for myself.</p><p><figure><img src=https://a.l3n.co/i/ujq7Pq.jpg><figcaption><h4>Leaving Klamath Falls</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://d.l3n.co/i/ujqHjA.jpg><figcaption><h4>And into the mountains</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://a.l3n.co/i/ujBKei.jpg><figcaption><h4>Riding into Crater Lake National Park</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://c.l3n.co/i/ujqldM.jpg><figcaption><h4>A good campsite the night before a bad day</h4></figcaption></figure></p><p>The first day out of Klamath Falls I camped short of Crater Lake National Park, opting instead to camp for free in the National Forest. The campsites in the National Parks can be quite expensive because they charge the same price whether you&rsquo;re one guy on a bicycle or ten people in two cars. Some places have special &ldquo;hiker biker&rdquo; sites for those travelling without a car, but those have been few and far between. I packed a beer on my way out of Klamath Falls and enjoyed a nice camping spot along Annie creek all to myself.</p><p><figure><img src=https://a.l3n.co/i/ujqzMQ.jpg><figcaption><h4>Snow starting as I make my way up</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://c.l3n.co/i/ujqSaa.jpg><figcaption><h4>The descent from Crater Lake</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://d.l3n.co/i/ujqn6e.jpg><figcaption><h4>Chilly trees</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://c.l3n.co/i/ujqvzk.jpg><figcaption><h4>The snow turning into rain</h4></figcaption></figure></p><p>The next morning, shortly after starting up again, it started snowing. It was light at first but got heavier and heavier the higher I went. I took a break under the roof at the entrance toll booth to the park; there was no one there. It was a heavy, wet snow by then, which made it tough to stay dry. Eventually, after a few hours of slow climbing, I made it to the visitor&rsquo;s center that I was happy to find open. I was invited inside to watch the short Crater Lake documentary film, which I rewatched several times as I warmed up in the theater. Once sufficiently reheated, I brainstormed together with park rangers Bonnie, Ayden, and Kate about my new best route to Portland.</p><p><figure><img src=https://b.l3n.co/i/ujqLbx.jpg><figcaption><h4>Spending a few hours at Beckie's Restaurant</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://d.l3n.co/i/ujqYtH.jpg><figcaption><h4>Dry, warm, and ready to ride</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://b.l3n.co/i/ujqoK1.jpg><figcaption><h4>Wet conditions</h4></figcaption></figure></p><p>There were three major routes I could&rsquo;ve taken north from here. The coast, with it&rsquo;s strong northerly winds, was already off the table way back in California. The east side of the Cascades was now proving to be too snowy on account of being too high. We quickly came to the conclusion that the best alternative was to descend to interstate 5 and to ride the parallel auxiliary roads. I abandoned the plan to stay up high riding dirt roads in the mountains and didn&rsquo;t feel all too upset about it. Boom, decision made, let&rsquo;s bundle up and descend to warmer climes.</p><p><figure><img src=https://d.l3n.co/i/ujquPc.jpg><figcaption><h4>Nice skies</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://c.l3n.co/i/ujqNjK.jpg><figcaption><h4>Carrying on past sunset over Lost Creek Lake</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://d.l3n.co/i/ujBpxo.jpg><figcaption><h4>Up and over into the Umpqua National Forest</h4></figcaption></figure></p><p>The snow from up high quickly turned to a cold rain. Pretty miserable right about now. Without fenders on the bike there was plenty of water spraying up from the road, so my pants and shoes were properly soaked. I put on some dry socks, put my feet in plastic bags, and put my shoes back on. Looking pretty glamorous, I happened upon Beckie&rsquo;s restaurant where I manned a booth for a few hours. Bottomless coffee, shepherd&rsquo;s pie, blueberry pie Ã  la mode, let&rsquo;s go! After a few hours warming up in the restaurant the rain had subsided and I hopped back on the bike. It wasn&rsquo;t the best of days as the dreary, dark weather can make it feel like the world is closing in on you. In the town of Prospect I chatted with Shane, a man working at a gas station, who spoke excellent Dutch. Small world. I rode on a bit further past sunset to a nearly empty campground. I was exhausted and it had been a pretty bad day. For the first time on my trip I slept terribly. Maybe it was all of the coffee?</p><p><figure><img src=https://a.l3n.co/i/ujqPqZ.jpg><figcaption><h4>Lunch break and drying my sleeping gear out</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://c.l3n.co/i/ujqfMP.jpg><figcaption><h4>A nice, quiet road</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://d.l3n.co/i/ujqFhm.jpg><figcaption><h4>And a good moment</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://a.l3n.co/i/ujBOR9.jpg><figcaption><h4>Closed logging roads</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://b.l3n.co/i/ujBH72.jpg><figcaption><h4>A cool covered bridge in Douglas County</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://b.l3n.co/i/ujqcCi.jpg><figcaption><h4>Nowhere special</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://a.l3n.co/i/ujqXzo.jpg><figcaption><h4>Cool mailbox</h4></figcaption></figure></p><p>I made it down to Shady Cove the next morning, stocked up on some food, used the WiFi at the library, and then turned north again. What followed were two nice days riding toward the I-5 corridor through the Umpqua National Forest and seeing some logging areas in operation. Those two days were actually really nice. I had managed to avoid more rain, the sky was dynamic with lifting fog and cool clouds, the roads were quiet, and there were plenty of friendly folks out and about. I rode past the very Wes Anderson looking Ranch Motel in Rice Hill and stopped to learn more. Owners Tim and Lisa were excited about my enthusiasm and gave me a tour and fed me lunch. Once along the I-5, though, the road became quite busy until I made it to Eugene.</p><p><figure><img src=https://b.l3n.co/i/ujqbw9.jpg><figcaption><h4>Foggy hill</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://c.l3n.co/i/ujqx12.jpg><figcaption><h4>On the logging cut-trough</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://a.l3n.co/i/ujqyKv.jpg><figcaption><h4>And back on the road</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://b.l3n.co/i/ujq5fC.jpg><figcaption><h4>And off the road again</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://c.l3n.co/i/ujqaj5.jpg><figcaption><h4>A logging depot</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://d.l3n.co/i/ujqhqz.jpg><figcaption><h4>With some cool machines</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://c.l3n.co/i/ujB2YT.jpg><figcaption><h4>One of the nicest tool stores I've ever visited!</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://d.l3n.co/i/ujB8hb.jpg><figcaption><h4>Bad cycling roads</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://d.l3n.co/i/ujBlFv.jpg><figcaption><h4>The Ranch Motel in Rice Hill, Oregon</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://b.l3n.co/i/ujBWC7.jpg><figcaption><h4>No tent campers allowed at this roadside spot</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://c.l3n.co/i/ujBiSr.jpg><figcaption><h4>The Umpqua River</h4></figcaption></figure></p><p>In Eugene I stayed a few nights with John and Lisa and then with Tomoko. The weather forecast for the Willamette valley was looking bad but I had to carry on. I stayed with Warmshowers hosts all the way to Portland. As much as I had previously wanted to see this quite well known wine region, now I just wanted to stay dry and get to Portland. It was consistent rain and it wasn&rsquo;t letting up. I figured this was that Pacific Northwest weather everyone was always talking about.</p><p><figure><img src=https://a.l3n.co/i/ujBjwF.jpg><figcaption><h4>Truck</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://c.l3n.co/i/ujBI13.jpg><figcaption><h4>Fire hydrant</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://b.l3n.co/i/ujBSIC.jpg><figcaption><h4>The Willamette Valley scenic bikeway</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://b.l3n.co/i/ujBZp0.jpg><figcaption><h4>John was curious what my bike weighed</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://a.l3n.co/i/ujBgfD.jpg><figcaption><h4>Mushrooms popping out of Tomoko's garden</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://d.l3n.co/i/ujBt0q.jpg><figcaption><h4>Sy's pizza in Eugene</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://a.l3n.co/i/ujB1BA.jpg><figcaption><h4>Halloween cop car</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://b.l3n.co/i/ujBRYM.jpg><figcaption><h4>Nice countryside</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://a.l3n.co/i/ujBE2Q.jpg><figcaption><h4>A quiet little stretch leaving Eugene</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://d.l3n.co/i/ujBkCa.jpg><figcaption><h4>Yeehaw</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://c.l3n.co/i/ujB6Se.jpg><figcaption><h4>A nice little roadside spot where I got to speak some Spanish again</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://b.l3n.co/i/ujBCxk.jpg><figcaption><h4>Picking up some screws</h4></figcaption></figure></p><p>In Portland I stayed with Lisa for a week as I decided what my next move would be. I&rsquo;d found the road through northern California and Oregon quite tough and the weather wasn&rsquo;t helping one bit. For now, the cycling had been uncomfortable and not at all fun but going further north, later in the year could also be dangerous. I roamed around Portland for a few days, read books, ate pizza, and called with family and friends to help me make a decision.</p><p><figure><img src=https://a.l3n.co/i/ujBeB5.jpg><figcaption><h4>Riding into Portland</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://d.l3n.co/i/ujBQ1x.jpg><figcaption><h4>A very nice Pedestrian/cyclist/light-rail bridge</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://c.l3n.co/i/ujBVpH.jpg><figcaption><h4>The Steel Bridge in Portland</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://a.l3n.co/i/ujB9F1.jpg><figcaption><h4>Eating some pizza before Powell's Books! An incredible used bookstore in Portland</h4></figcaption></figure></p><p>I found Klaas and Michelle who were willing and able to store my bike for the winter and I also found a cheap flight home. It ended up being a pretty easy decision once I let go of any self-imposed demands to keep my trip continuous, whatever that means, and just keyed in on what I really wanted to do right now. I stored my bike, said &ldquo;see ya later,&rdquo; and got on the plane.</p><p><figure><img src=https://b.l3n.co/i/ujBq0c.jpg><figcaption><h4>A fun street mural</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://c.l3n.co/i/ujBBBK.jpg><figcaption><h4>Sunset over Portland</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://b.l3n.co/i/ujBmoZ.jpg><figcaption><h4>The Steel Bridge again</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://a.l3n.co/i/ujB32P.jpg><figcaption><h4>A nice sign in downtown Portland</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://d.l3n.co/i/ujB4Jm.jpg><figcaption><h4>Another cool sign in outer Portland</h4></figcaption></figure></p><p>Now about five months later I&rsquo;m back in Portland and honestly quite excited for these last few months of riding. I think it will be a really beautiful part of the trip with some of the most remote and rugged landscapes I&rsquo;ve yet come across. I&rsquo;m glad I took the time to wait and to allow myself to recharge; the only fear I have now is whether or not I can pick the trip up again where I left off. Only one way to find out!</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/stevb rel=me title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a>
